This repo is part of the tutorial *PostgreSQL for MySQL DBA's* available at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN41e11CmxvbTYKwrTNLG1w.

This tutorial is focused on teaching PostgreSQL to professionals who are already experienced with databases, especially MySQL. A beginner may adapt the concepts easily but [s]he needs to know the basic concepts of a relational database. 

We start from the principle that relational databases share a lot of similar concepts and you may find it easier if we help you relate the concepts of PostgreSQL with MySQL. Thus, we will start with PostgreSQL Architecture for MySQL DBAs and proceed with most common installation methods, configuration and so on.

The approach we take within this tutorial is to present an overview of the PostgreSQL architecture and operation in view of MySQL's. We will build a lab together to practice everything we discuss here. Note that we will mix lecture with hands-on work and you, the listener, have to apply those very same concepts we present here in practice in your lab before covering new ones. We will start with a simple and quick installation of PostgreSQL and then walk all the way to set up and maintain a stand by replica. By the end of this training you shall be able to have a good understanding of how PostgreSQL works, and feel confident enough to try it yourself elsewhere.
